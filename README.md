<h1>Overview</h1>
The workflow for this project includes four essential parts:
<br/><br/>

<ol>
    <li>Building a training set</li>
    <li>Training a computer vision model</li>
    <li>Processing videos with the trained model</li>
    <li>Extracting descriptive information from the predictions (i.e, obtaining flight duration, heading, etc.)</li>
</ol>

To complete Parts 1 & 4, you'll need to use the Python application found in this repository. This portion of the workflow can be completed on your own machine. Conversely, Parts 2 & 3 will need to be done using Google Colab and the provided notebook 'AdaptedNeuralNet.ipynb'. Installation and running instructions can be found in the 'INSTALLATION & RUN' file.
