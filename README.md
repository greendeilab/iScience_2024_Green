This repository contains information related to the iScience publication "Modular switches control a shift in monarch butterfly migratory flight behavior at their Mexican overwintering sites" by Delbert A. Green II, Sean Polidori and Samuel Stratton.

<h1>Overview</h1>
The workflow for this project/application includes four essential parts:
<br/><br/>

<ol>
    <li>Train a computer vision model to identify the monarch as well as any key characteristics of our setup.</li>
    <li>Run the model on input videos (i.e. have our model predict on each frame of our videos).</li>
    <li>Extract descriptive information from the videos (e.g. butterfly heading direction, wingbeat frequency, etc.).</li>
</ol>
